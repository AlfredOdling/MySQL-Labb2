            This project involves building a web application in React from
            scratch; UX, backend and frontend development. The application
            consist of a landingpage, adminpage, webshop and a servicepage.
          </p>

          <p>
            My classmate Simon Asp and I built this web application during
            period of 10 months and is my longest project so far.

            During a four month period I was hired as an consultant for a
            startup called Tremory. During this time we focused on the business
            end of things and the technology infrastructure.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We relied heavily on the books "Lean Startup" by Eric Ries and
            "Hacking Growth" by Sean Ellis & Morgan Brown. So after the business
            design and our value and growth hypothesis formed, I started to
            implement our first experiment and MVP.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            What I built was the mobile version to complement the web
            application. Our requirements was that the application should be
            secure, scalable and fast. I developed the mobile application with
            React Native and implemented everything in Redux and prepared so
            that it should be easily transferred to implement a web application
            in React later on because as of now that technology stack is
            outdated.

            application.

            I worked as an frontend developer for the JPX (Japan Exchange Group)
            trading GUI at Cinnober the summer of 2016. Here I worked with super
            talanted developers that taught me to develop in React. This is also
            where I learned scrum for the first time.

          <p>
            In the summer of 2017 I worked with a startup called Phocus. My job
            was to develop a new landing page and then implement and launch the
            site using Wix (because of time restraints).

            I was responsible for the IT architecture and the UX. The app is
